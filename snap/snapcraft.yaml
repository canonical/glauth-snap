description: |
  Go-lang LDAP Authentication (GLAuth) is a secure, easy-to-use,
   LDAP server w/ configurable backends.

  Centrally manage accounts across your infrastructure.
  Centrally manage SSH keys, Linux accounts, and passwords for cloud servers.
  Lightweight alternative to OpenLDAP and Active Directory for development, or
   a homelab.
  Store your user directory in a file, local or in S3; SQL database; or proxy
   to existing LDAP servers.
  Two Factor Authentication (transparent to applications).
  Multiple backends can be chained to inject features.
  Use it to centralize account management across your Linux servers, your OSX
   machines, and your support applications (Jenkins, Apache/Nginx, Graylog2,
    and many more!).
